# NICK ALERT ##########
# Hardware functionality may be commented out, simply so that people can work on code from their desktops
# I attempted to comment things out in a way that makes it easy to restore full functionality on RasPi
# For example
# savePro = Button(profilePage, text='Save')#, command=(lambda e=ents: sf.fetch(e)))
# This button has a # after the final parenthesis, so that i could test button without working function
# It can simply be restored by deleting the extra parenthesis and '#', as rest of line was preserved
